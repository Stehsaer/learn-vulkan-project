## About This Repository

This repository contains code I write while learning Vulkan.

It mainly consists of:

- `./vklib-hpp`: My customized C++ wrapper of original Vulkan C++ wrapper from Khronos.

- `./projects`: Projects created while learning Vulkan.

  - `./projects/deferred-shading-cpp`: A program for rendering GLTF using traditional rasterizer, utilizes and experiments with various real-time rendering techniques.

- `./decrepated`: Decrepated projects, created using C API at the very early stage of learning Vulkan.
